-EMPID is the primary key instead of the username(username should still be unique)
-In mysql we can save photos as BLOB, but it's not a best practice to save photos directly in the database 
 so we suggest storing the photos somewhere(physical machine or cloud(cloud is recomended))
 and only save their path/URL inside the database
 -Remove the role table and store the roles as enum. That saves us lookup time and role table doesn't have any CRUD operations and only have three entries no more
  (it is more of a dictionary than a table)
-Rename tables activities and subactivities to Categories and activities In addition to renaming the attributes inside each table.
- Drop dynamic menu table (UI elements that don't need to be stored inside the database as it is fixed )
- Drop post table as it is a draft (deleted from the 'Screens initial draft.ptx' propsed).
- Drop status table and insert Status field of type enum('Approved','Declined','Pending') in both redemption requests and activivty requests tables.
- remove evidence needed attribute from request table (proof of actio attribute is sufficient)
- Rename Redeem Master data to vendors Rename redeem sub master data to voucher 
-Remove start and end date from vendor(Master data)
-Add a notification table.
